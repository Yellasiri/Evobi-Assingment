# GitHub Codespaces ♥️ React

Welcome to your shiny new Codespace running React! We've got everything fired up and running for you to explore React.

You've got a blank canvas to work on from a git perspective as well. There's a single initial commit with the what you're seeing right now - where you go from here is up to you!

Everything you do here is contained within this one codespace. There is no repository on GitHub yet. If and when you’re ready you can click "Publish Branch" and we’ll create your repository and push up your project. If you were just exploring then and have no further need for this code then you can simply delete your codespace and it's gone forever.

This project was bootstrapped for you with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

We've already run this for you in the `Codespaces: server` terminal window below. If you need to stop the server for any reason you can just run `npm start` again to bring it back online.

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in the built-in Simple Browser (`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P > Simple Browser: Show`) to view your running application.

The page will reload automatically when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

1st Screen - Product Description:
the user to the first screen, which includes an interactive component (the "START" button) and a textual description of the product.
You can structure this page using React components. To style it properly, use CSS.

2nd Screen - Part Selection:

When the user clicks the "START" button, navigate to the second screen.
On this screen, display a horizontal scrollable list of all the product parts in card views. Each card should contain an image and the part name.
Implement the selection mechanism using checkboxes or by highlighting selected parts. Allow users to select any number of parts.
Use React state to manage the selected parts and update the UI accordingly.

3rd Screen - Part Assembly:

Upon selecting the parts on the second screen, navigate to the third screen.
On this screen, create a drag-and-drop interface for assembling the selected parts.
Display a vertical scrollable panel on the left side of the screen with the selected part images.
Implement drag-and-drop functionality using libraries like react-dnd or native HTML5 drag-and-drop.
Users can assemble the parts in any order they prefer. Keep track of the assembled parts in the component's state.

4th Screen - Final Product:

Once the user has assembled the parts, navigate to the fourth screen to show the final product view.
Display the assembled product in the center of the screen.
You can use CSS transitions to make the assembly process visually appealing.
